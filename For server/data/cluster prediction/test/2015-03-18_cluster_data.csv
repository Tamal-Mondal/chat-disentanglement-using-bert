2,<galentanner> I'm just going in circles.  Is there anything I can do?,1
3,<gr33n7007h> that system is a mess,1
4,<galentanner> I guess so.,1
5,<gr33n7007h> what was the dpkg command?,1
6,<galentanner> I don't know.  I'm not a programmer.  I am just trying everything I can find.,1
7,<gr33n7007h> is this a new install of xubuntu?,1
8,<galentanner> I've had it on this machine for a couple weeks.,1
9,<Xanather> is xubuntu exactly the same as ubuntu except with a different UI?,2
10,<gr33n7007h> Xanather: yes,2
11,<Xanather> okay thought so thanks,2
12,"<gr33n7007h> you got anything on that is important, cos without knowing what you done this could take forever",1
13,<galentanner> Are we talking about wiping and reinstalling?,1
14,"<gr33n7007h> galentanner: yes, if need be",1
15,<galentanner> There is no way to find out what is running and shut it down?,1
16,<gr33n7007h> or you could just use wired until your new usb wifi stick comes,1
17,<galentanner> I guess so.,1
18,"<ebernhardson> well sure, you can `sudo fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock` to get a list of processes that have that file open, but just shutting it down may not really help",1
19,<galentanner> Would that tell us what is running and causing this?,1
20,"<ebernhardson> it gives you a PID, a process id",1
21,"<galentanner> ok..I did that it came back ""2335""",1
22,<ebernhardson> then `ps aux | grep 2335`,1
23,<galentanner> galentanner@ubuntu:~$ ps aux | grep 2335,1
24,<galentanner> root      2335  0.0  0.0  19560    88 ?        S    21:58   0:00 dpkg --configure -a,1

26,<galentanner> ok.,1
27,<ebernhardson> so that says you have dpkg open and its trying to configure all unconfigured packages.  Do you have a terminal open somewhere thats running apt-get ?,1
28,"<ebernhardson> or aptitude, or i bet ubuntu has a few other programs these days (i cant keep up)",1
29,<galentanner> I have one open that I'm using to do the commands.,1
30,"<ebernhardson> try `ps auf`, that should draw some nice lines between parents and children to ee who owns the dpkg --configure process",1
31,"<ebernhardson> you'll have to look through it for the dpkg line, then trace back the lines its draws",1
32,<galentanner> I'm not smart enough for that..,1
33,<galentanner> galentanner@ubuntu:~$ ps auf,1

38,<ebernhardson> you'll have to use a paste site for more than a couple lines :),1
39,"<ebernhardson> but basically you see the line it drew from ps auf to bash?  wherever your dpkg --configure -a is, it should have similar lines.  If not means its unparented",1

41,"<ebernhardson> it is unattached,  i forgot you need `ps auxf`,  the x shows the unattached processes",1
42,"<galentanner> should I run the "" ps auxf ""?",1
43,<ebernhardson> yes,1
44,"<ebernhardson> just guessing, but with it showing a ? for TTY its probably spawned from a GUI program",1

47,<manpriya> #ceph,3
48,<galentanner> I think my head is about to explode.,1
49,"<ebernhardson> you can try `sudo kill 3280`, basically it looks like dpkg is configuring some package(can't tell becaue it cuts off on the right hand side), and the modprobe command is stuffed",1
50,<galentanner> ok,1
51,<galentanner> done,1
52,"<ebernhardson> ps auxf again,  is modprobe still listed with a line drawn to it from dpkg --configure?",1
53,<florian> hi,4
54,`hypermist` is now known as sleepypc,5
55,"<ebernhardson> reasonable chance since modprobe talks directly to the kernel that a plain kill wasn't enough.  TBH the ""easiest"" way might just be a reboot (hard reboot if necessary)",1
56,<galentanner> http://pastebin.com/nWAaGzYN,1
57,"<ebernhardson> dpkg looks to no longer be listed, in theory that also means dpkg is no longer locked and whatever you were trying to do with it should be possible now",1
58,<galentanner> What's the difference between a reboot and a hard reboot?,1
59,<ebernhardson> galentanner: a hard reboot is when you just shut off the power without letting the machine do a proper shutdown,1
60,<galentanner> oh.  ok.,1
61,"<galentanner> I'm trying to get the Broadcom 4318 wireless card to work.  Everyone says it's supported, but I can't get it to work.",1
62,"<ebernhardson> galentanner: not generally suggested, although not as dangerous now as it used to be :) but can be necessary when things that talk to the kernel get stuffed and refuse to complete (but not necessary in your current situation)",1
63,<galentanner> ok,1
64,"<ebernhardson> getting hardware to work is a pain in the ass, i have an IT department that chooses laptops for me :)",1
65,<galentanner> Nice.  I am the IT department.  I'm an idiot.  I just want it to work...,1

68,<galentanner> sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source,1
69,<galentanner> sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree,1
70,<galentanner> Should I try them now?,1
71,<ebernhardson> sounds reasonable,1
72,<galentanner> here goes....,1
73,<galentanner> I think the first one is working now.,1
74,kernel is now known as Guest25080,6
75,<galentanner> The first command seems to have finished.  Should I reboot or run the second command?,1
76,"<ebernhardson> just run the next one, you hardly need to reboot a linux box",1
77,<galentanner> ok...,1
78,<galentanner> second one is chewing,1
79,<galentanner> linux-firmware-nonfree is already the newest version.,1
80,"<galentanner> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 11 not upgraded.",1
81,<galentanner> Is this ok?,1
82,"<ebernhardson> it means the package is installed, and thats what you wanted, so i guess yes?",1
83,<galentanner> So the website calls for a couple modprobe commands next....,1
84,<galentanner> sudo modprobe -rv b43,1
85,<galentanner> sudo modprobe -v b43,1
86,<ebernhardson> basically that means remove and re-insert the b43 driver,1
87,<galentanner> ok...,1
88,<ebernhardson> (you can `man modprobe` to get a manual page explaining all of this),1
89,"<ebernhardson> man is the manual command, works for most all things you can type into the command line",1
90,<ebernhardson> quality of the manual varies greatly though :),1
91,<galentanner> This is what I did..,1
92,<galentanner> galentanner@ubuntu:~$ sudo modprobe -rv b43,1

94,<galentanner> insmod /lib/modules/3.13.0-46-generic/kernel/drivers/ssb/ssb.ko,1
95,<galentanner> The website says I may need to reboot now.  Should I?,1
96,"<ebernhardson> it seems odd they want you to remove and reinsert the kernel module, then reboot.  but sure why not",1
97,"<galentanner> Then the wireless should be working, you think?",1
98,<ebernhardson> a definite maybe :),1
99,"<galentanner> I'll be back in a jif....BTW, thanks for the help.  You are very kind a patient.",1

131,<galentanner> cool. That's awesome!,1
132,<KurisuIRC> #justircthings,1
133,<galentanner> Thanks all.  I've read that fixing the wireless might allow the computer to actually poweroff.  What do you think?,1
134,<ebernhardson> depends why it wont power off ),1
135,<KurisuIRC> ...? what was the problem originally,1
136,"<ebernhardson> sometimes if it wont power off you can ctrl-alt-F7 (or F1, F2, try them all) to end up at a screen that has some debug output",1
137,<ebernhardson> but only sometimes,1
138,<galentanner> It just sits there and runs after restart or shutdown command either from GUI or from the command line.  I have to unplug the battery and the power cord to get it to shut off.,1
139,"<ebernhardson> also instead of unplugging everything, many computers and laptops will force a shutdown if you just hold the power button for >5s",1
140,<galentanner> I've tried that.  doesn't work here.,1
141,<ebernhardson> :(,1
142,"<galentanner> So, If I use the shutdown command in the gui system.  The screen will go black.  After a few minutes, I, Instead of unplugging everything, try the ctrl-alt- F7...etc.  That should generate some code?",1
143,"<ebernhardson> if your lucky, one of them will have some debug output on them.  Its not really generated at that point though basically those are virtual terminals that always exist but are not typically seen these days because everything boots straight into GUI",1
144,"<galentanner> SO, If is hit those buttons, the system will send the report the next startup?",1
145,xCore is now known as xCore|sleep,8
146,"<ebernhardson> sorry no, i mean those are text consoles (like the one you type your commands into in the gui) that still exist from the days before GUI was popular",1
147,<ebernhardson> if you are lucky some debug output goes to one of them when shutting down,1
148,<ebernhardson> they wont persist through a reboot,1
149,"<galentanner> so, I'll see the output, write it downand send it out.",1

169,"<darius93> I have a question about shred, it is said that it zeros the file (or partition if one decide to use that feature) but when it comes to zeroing a file, why does it run so fast? I havent tried using it with a partition but if I use dd to destroy a file, it takes slightly longer depending on if its a hdd, ssd, whats io operations going on on disk, etc",11
170,"<rypervenche> darius93: If you're using dd on a disk, it's using 512 bytes by default, which is extremely slow. If you were to use 32M for example for the byte size, it would go much more quickly.",11
171,<darius93> Ah that explains it but I generally use 1M,11
172,"<rypervenche> darius93: I've also found shred to be a little slow, but I've never done a side-by-side. They are both binaries that do different things, so yeah.",11

174,"<darius93> rypervenche, i never used it against a drive itself, just files to securely erase them, but i guess it varies. Shred does do several passes through the file (i think 4 or 24 passes by default) which is why it is slower than dd which only does one pass through",11

181,"<rypervenche> cage: Well, so long as the directory is decrypted your files are just as opened as unencrypted files.",13

279,<ikonia> the user is simple ???,38
280,<ikonia> what has the user got to do with it ?,38
281,"<zetheroo1> yes, the user has only ever used network manager",38
282,"<ikonia> zetheroo1: ok - so you need to interact with network manager directly then, not dhclient",38
283,<ikonia> as network manager is calling/managing the stak,38
284,<zetheroo1> well the user is not one to go tinkering with /etc/network/interfaces file or anything else,38
285,<zetheroo1> ok,38
286,<newuser789> what kind of file .zsync is ? what to do with it ? zetheroo1 http://mirror.yandex.ru/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.2/release/,42
287,<ikonia> stack,38
288,<zzarr> basically what I'm asking is: is a table/computer with a USB-mobile-internet-modem considered a phone?,41
289,<geirha> newuser789: zsync is a way to download similar files without downloading everything each time,42
290,<newuser789> geirha: just like torrent or something else ? and how to use it ?,42
291,<zetheroo1> ikonia: I really am not finding anything about using the network manager to reassign DHCP IP's though,38
292,"<geirha> newuser789: the file is split into sizable pieces, then checksums for each piece is stored in the .zsync file.  When you download with zsync, you provide it with similar files you've already downloaded. It checks those files if they have any matching pieces, and only downloads any missing ones.",42
293,"<ikonia> zetheroo1: stop the network, remove the lease file, start the network is a hard way around it",38
294,"<geirha> newuser789: It's mainly for the daily images, where today's and yesterday's image likely only contains a few differences. So you might end up downloading 10% of the actual size instead of 100%",42
295,<ikonia> zetheroo1: that will just depend on the servers reservation then,38
296,"<zzarr> there seems to be a app called ""dia-gnomeler-app""",41
297,<zzarr> but the package can't be found,41
298,<zetheroo1> ikonia: the lease has been removed from the server for this PC,38
299,<ikonia> zetheroo1: ok - so remove it from the server,38
300,<zetheroo1> so 'service networking stop' and then remove this file ... and then 'service networking start',38
301,"<newuser789> geirha: sounds like its same as torrent, files are split and their hashes are stored in torrent file, when we download then it checks for missing pieces and downloads the missing ones",42
302,<ikonia> zetheroo1: seems a simple approach,38
303,"<ikonia> you could also look at the nmcli options, see if there is a renew/release option",38
304,"<geirha> newuser789: similar, sure, but you only download from the one server, not other peers",42
305,"<newuser789> geirha: ohh, so zsync is centralized to a single server and torrent is decentralized to seeds and peers, torrents can be dangerous but zsync will be verified by server",42
306,<newuser789> my messages are visible /readable ?,43
307,<eahm> yes,43
308,<jbo> Y,43
309,<newuser789> so how to use zsync ?,42

311,<k1l> newuser789: read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage,42

336,<Fizzy_Changeling> newuser789: Torrent is faster,48
337,"<rypervenche> sre-su: No, it should be there no matter what, even for info.",45
338,<k1l> newuser789: its not rocketscience. just use one and check the iso (which torrent already does) and install it,48
339,<sre-su> rypervenche: And is it possible to know what all commands were issued?,45
340,<newuser789> Fizzy_Changeling: which one is advicable ? Fizzy_Changeling k1l,48
