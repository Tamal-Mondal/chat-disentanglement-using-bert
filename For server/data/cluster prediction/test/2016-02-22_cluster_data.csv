294,<silvian> has it added it to the ppa list?,36
295,<nick420> ok. seems good,36
296,<silvian> ok,36
297,"<patarr> EriC^^, I tried both - but I think I found the issue. Line endings. I made the file on windows. Wrote the file again in vim on the OS, and it seems to work.",40
298,<silvian> now do,36
299,<silvian> sudo apt-get update,36
300,<patarr> Damn line endings.,40
301,<EriC^^> oh,40
302,<silvian> to refresh your ppa library,36
303,<nick420> ok done,36
304,<silvian> good now run,36
305,<silvian> sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer,36
306,"<wellick> Pici: ok, thanks",41
307,<nick420> going to take a few minutes,36
308,"<travisthenavi> I recently changed my OS to Xubuntu Linux (14.04 LTS). I want to download the LAMP stack for web development. Should I install PHP and MySQL seperately, or just install the whole stack as one package?",43
309,<silvian> @nick420: sure... sounds like you're the right track anyway,36
310,<silvian> after that's finished doing everything,36
311,<silvian> run java --version,36
312,<Hakon> hello. I'm trying to figure out a problem with idmapd where it takes quite a while for it to resolve username and group for folders over nfs4. If i just signed into the machine then the folders have 4294967294 for 3-4 minutes or so before changing to the correct value. has anyone experienced this?,44
313,<silvian> to confirm you got java 1.8 installed :),36
314,<MonkeyDust> travisthenavi  the MP means Mysql and PHP,43
315,"<travisthenavi> Yeah, I also will need Apache. I forgot.",43
316,<SchrodingersScat> travisthenavi: is there even a virtual package for 'lamp'?,43
317,<tsapii> you could find it using `which`,36
318,<tgm4883> nick420: you're just trying to play minecraft? How did you install java?,36
319,"<tsapii> e.g. for me, `which java` produces /usr/bin/java",36
320,<tgm4883> silvian: tell me to go away if you've got this covered :),36
321,"<tsapii> which is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/java, which in turn is a symlink to /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java",36
322,<nick420> not that i see anywhere no,36
323,<datamancer_> Hi all. How can I update Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 to 14.04.4?,45
324,<silvian> no worries :) your help is appreciated,36
325,<silvian> yeah try typing which java,36
326,<tgm4883> datamancer_: you get it via regular apt updates,45
327,<silvian> it might installed somewhere else,36
328,<silvian> usually its /usr/lib,36
329,<tsapii> readlink -f `which java` should reveal its path,36
330,"<datamancer_> tgm4883: Right, thanks, but I'm a bit confused as to which command to run to do it. Is it apt-get upgrade?",45
331,dearn_ is now known as dearn,46
332,<tgm4883> datamancer_: yes,45
333,<datamancer_> tgm4883: tyvm :),45
334,"<Bashing-om> datamancer_: "" sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade ; sudo apt full-upgrade "" should be all there is to it .",45
335,"<latenite_> Hi folks, how can I determine when the latest firefox update was available for update?",47
336,"<dragonbite> If all you are doing is Minecraft, openjdk-7-jre also works and it is in the repos.",36
337,<sethj> when it *was* or when it *will be*?,47
338,<silvian> @nick420: try typing this,36
339,<silvian> readlink -f `which java`,36
340,"<Andocromn> i'm working on an Ubuntu Remix live cd, i have it mostly working except on bootup i get a number of authentication failure messages and no console or login prompt.  does anyone know how to fix this?",48
341,<silvian> it should reveal exact path as tsapii suggested,36
342,<silvian> so we can add it to your java home,36
343,<debug0x1> http://www.meetup.com/HackerNestNYC/events/227143576/,49
344,<tgm4883> nick420: How did you install java? And is this openjdk? All I needed to do was install openjdk-8-jre and then run the jar,36
345,"<tgm4883> (although technically, I run it through multimc since I like lots of mods)",36
346,<silvian> no its oracle's. We had no luck getting minecraft working with open jdk,36
347,<xangua> latenite_: check Firefox releases notes? Wikipedia history release?,47
348,"<dragonbite> can run using ""java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar",36
349,<nick420> silvian gave me a walk through and all seemed to work but the game will still not open,36
350,<silvian> had to install oracle jdk for him,36
351,"<dragonbite> sorry, ""java -jar <path to>/Minecraft.jar"" (without quotes)",36
352,"<latenite_> xangua, I mean when it made its way to ubuntu.",47
353,<tgm4883> silvian: was there an error? What version of minecraft? It should work fine with openjdk,36
354,<silvian> yeah that's what i though... no nick420 didn't specify the error,36
355,"<latenite_> xangua, I want to compare the release dates of the offical sites of firefox to the dates of some distros",47
356,<silvian> anyway should be there configuring this... we just need to set $JAVA_HOME environment variable,36
357,<silvian> so I've asked nick420 to run: readlink -f `which java`,36
358,<silvian> to find out what the install path is,36
359,<dragonbite> silvian: what about trying to uninstall it and then install openjdk or oracle java again?,36
360,* tgm4883 wonders if it's not a java issue...,36
361,<silvian> its installed fine i think its just a matter of configuring JAVA_HOME now,36
362,<nick420> it says this /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java,36
363,<silvian> good ok now copy that exactly into your clipboard,36
364,<silvian> and now run export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java,36
365,<latenite_> anyone? I don't use ubuntu and could really use some help here :D,47
366,<nick420> clipboard..? lol,36
367,<silvian> whatever... ctrl +C,36
368,<silvian> :P,36
369,<Bashing-om> latenite_: Then there is a need for you to run ubuntu .,47
370,<silvian> just paste this and run it,36
371,<silvian> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java,36
372,<tgm4883> latenite_: why?,47
373,"<latenite_> Bashing-om, I was hoping to find the data I need online in the repos or some git...",47
374,"<nick420> i pasted ""export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java"" and nothing happend",36
375,"<latenite_> tgm4883, so I can compare how fast/slow software updates get into the different distros.",47
376,<dragonbite> latenite: have you looked at http://packages.ubuntu.com ?  It doesn't give you the date but gives you the version,47
377,<tsapii> nick420: you specified the java binary as JAVA_HOME,36
378,"<tsapii> remove the ""bin/java"" part",36
379,"<Bashing-om> latenite_: You can always ask, if it is not ubuntu related we can redirect so you get the help you need . Ask your question .",47
380,<silvian> that's fine,36
381,<silvian> it gives you no output back,36
382,"<latenite_> Bashing-om, tgm4883 xangua on gentoo it was easy for firefox https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/www-client/firefox/firefox-44.0.2.ebuild?id=2b761e9d635fee7a8c3ab20dfa54e20c0c1d737c",47
383,<silvian> just hit return key,36
384,<latenite_> 3 days,47
385,<tgm4883> latenite_: you'd need to go through the mailing list to get the upload dates I believe,47
386,<silvian> then close down your terminal,36
387,<silvian> and open it again,36
388,<silvian> then try running minecraft,36
389,<silvian> it should be set now,36
390,<tsapii> ...is it fine to specify it to the binary path? could've sworn that it had to be left out,36
391,<ks3> latenite_: If you're looking in the repos why couldn't you use the timestamp of the package?,47
392,"<latenite_> tgm4883, there is no logging or git? When it comes to ubuntu repos?",47
393,<tgm4883> latenite_: what ks3 said. That seems to be the best solution http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox/,47
394,"<latenite_> ks3, I found this file http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/main/binary-amd64/",47

397,<nick420> negative. says the same thing :(,36
398,<nick420> should i give up lol,36
399,<tgm4883> silvian: closing and reopening the terminal wipes the export,36
400,<tsapii> yeah,36
401,<tsapii> should add it to .bashrc,36
402,"<tgm4883> well, should export it first and see if it works",36
403,<tgm4883> only add it to .bashrc if it works,36
