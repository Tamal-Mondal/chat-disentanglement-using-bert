36,<Gnomethrower> Hey everyone. I was wondering if anyone knows a tool like fuser or lsof that works on FUSE filesystems when they crash,15
37,<ikonia> fuse file system ?,15
38,"<ikonia> it's not actually a file system, it's just how it's presented to the user over the network",15
39,<ikonia> eg: samba - is not actually a file system,15
40,"<Gnomethrower> specifically, if MooseFS or LizardFS or GlusterFS FUSE client crashes, with dir /storage/lfs as the mountpoint, I can't umount /storage/lfs until I kill anything using it. lsof and fuser however are useless in this scenario and do not work with crashed FUSE mountpoints",15
41,<Gnomethrower> ikonia: in this case I'm talking about actual filesystems. I'm aware FUSE is for other stuff too,15
42,<ikonia> Gnomethrower: what file system are you actually talking about then,15
43,<_peter_> @search pease,16
44,"<Gnomethrower> ikonia: LizardFS in this case, but we've seen the same behaviour from Gluster and MooseFS",15
45,"<ikonia> Gnomethrower: isn't this the same situation as any remote userspace mount, as then the mount goes the userdata/status is lost",15
46,<ikonia> so when you remount tools like lsof won't show anything,15
47,<hotspot> anybody know how to change channel on the ubuntu hotspot or some other software to create a hotspot without AP mode?,17
48,"<ikonia> so you fix it on the server which the file system is not a userspace mount, it's a local file system",15
49,<Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm not worried about remounting losing the status,15
50,"<Gnomethrower> ikonia: I'm wanting to unmount it from a client, but it won't let me while for example nginx is running",15
51,<Gnomethrower> and usually lsof/fuser would tell you what to kill to be able to successfully umount,15
52,<Gnomethrower> but lsof and fuser do not work on a crashed FUSE mountpoint,15
53,"<Gnomethrower> okay, apparently this is a kernel limitation and there's really no easy solution",15
54,<Gnomethrower> so consider my question solved I guess,15
55,"<diverdude> ikonia, if i set up chroot for a specific user logging on via ssh, would that user still be able to run rsync from his home directory to a remote server?",12

338,<marlo_> i located that in my /home/mark/Downloads/vdfuse folder!,74
339,<marlo_> i honestly don't know what that is... but i'm looking to see what i did,74
340,<marlo_> or the next question would be how do i remove it?,74
341,<marlo_> it's virtual box!,74

343,<marlo_> how do i get rid of it?,74
344,"<marlo_> (not virtual box, the error)",74
345,<ikonia> what is triggering the call to that script,74
346,<ikonia> I assume it's something within the custom initrd ?,74
347,"<marlo_> well, from what I've observed, updates to the system involve updates to initrd from virtualbox",74
348,"<marlo_> so that's part of it's typical function, beyond me",74

353,"<marlo_> ikonia, beats me",74
354,<marlo_> i've downloaded and installed it for years,74
355,"<ikonia> you won't be ""purge"" virtualbox as a package if you installed it as a non-package",74
356,<marlo_> it always seems to hook something in to initrd,74

368,<ikonia> lovely,74
369,<ogra_>  mv /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/vdfuse .,74

373,<marlo_> !,74
374,<marlo_> 5.0_5.0.14,74
375,<akik> i don't think vdfuse is a part of it(?). it was to do with mounting the virtual image files,74

377,<ogra_> it definitely isnt,74
378,<akik> nope,74
